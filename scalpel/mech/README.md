# mechanical design

All components were printed with an Ultimaker 3 Extended printer using PLA, 0.2 mm layer height, 20 \% infill (triangle pattern) and 0.4 mm nozzle diameter. 
Print settings were kept standard, 205 C extruder temperature, 70 mm/s travel speed and 3 perimeter layers. 
The components were printed at room temperature (~19-21 Â°C). 
The resulted prints were approximately 50 microns wider in XY direction.

cutting_tool_assembly.stl is given for illustrating the complete assembly.
